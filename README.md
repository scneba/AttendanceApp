### SCHOOL ATTENDANCE TRACKING WITH ANDROID AND WEB APPLICATION

Attendance  is  a  vital  tool  in  every  Organizationâ€™s  success  because  it  plays  a  great  role  in  its 
efficiency.  This  project  proposes  a  simple  way  of  taking  attendance  and  messaging  using  an 
android  and  a  web  application  connected  via  a  Local  Area  Network  (LAN)  without  need  for 
internet. The android application stores the user information and sends user attendance to the web 
application when  the user  comes into the coverage area of the LAN.  The web application then 
displays the attendance data in an interactive interface with attendance grading.
